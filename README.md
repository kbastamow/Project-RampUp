This was a solo homework project and all the mess in the code can be blamed on the author and no one else.
Please note that this is my first multi-page project and one of the first projects ever in HTML-CSS.

## Acknowledgements

Supportive teachers and classmates are the way forward. I would also like to express my gratitude to Google, as well as W3schools and Stack Overflow.
